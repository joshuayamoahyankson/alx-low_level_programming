Welcome to my ALX task/project about Static Library (0x09-static_libraries)

Title: Static library

Description: 
Command-line arguments are very useful. After all, C functions wouldn't be very useful if you couldn't ever pass arguments to them -- adding the ability to pass arguments to programs makes them that much more useful. In fact, all the arguments you pass on the command line end up as arguments to the main function in your program.

Requirements/Instructions

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
