Welcome to my File I/O project/task at ALX!

Title: File I/O

Description: Opens a text file for both reading and writing. It first truncates the file to zero length if it exists, otherwise creates a file if it does not exist.(Source: TutorialsPoint)

Requirements for the Project!

General:

1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
3. V
4. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
5. V
6. You are not allowed to use global variables
7. No more than 5 functions per file
8. The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
9. Allowed syscalls: read, write, open, close
10. You are allowed to use _putchar
11. You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
12. In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
13. The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
14. Don’t forget to push your header file
15. All your header files should be include guarded
16. Tip: always prefer using symbolic constants (POSIX) vs numbers when it makes sense. For instance read(STDIN_FILENO, ... vs read(0, ...
