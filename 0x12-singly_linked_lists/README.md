Welcome to ALX singly linked lists project.

Title: Singly linked lists.

Description: A Singly linked list is a collection of data called nodes, where each node is divided into two parts to store data and address at some random addresses. The pointer next, points to the address of the next node in a list. Compared to the array data structure, the size of the linked list elements is not fixed.(simplilearn.com)

You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
