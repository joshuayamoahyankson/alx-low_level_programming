Welcome to my alx projects on Doubly linked lists!

Topic: Doubly linked list

Description: A doubly linked list is a data structure where each node contains a value (or data) and two pointers: one pointing to the previous node (called prev) and another pointing to the next node (called next).
The prev pointer allows traversal in both directions (forward and backward).
