Welcome to my ALX SE task/project on C PreProcessor.

Below is the definition of what a C preprocessor is:

The C preprocessor is a macro preprocessor (allows you to define macros) that transforms your program before it is compiled. These transformations can be the inclusion of header files, macro expansions, etc. All preprocessing directives begin with a # symbol.

This task contains in total 5 questions.
They are:
0. Object-like Macro
Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.

1. Pi
Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.

2. File name
Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.

You are allowed to use the standard library

3. Function-like macro
Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.

4. SUM
Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
